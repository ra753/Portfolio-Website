            <div class="line"></div>
            <p>From the earliest of primitive humans with enough intelligence to understand and manipulate the world around them, to us the modern humans who dominate a planet and fortunately or rather unfortunately have power to transform the world we live in. Though there might not be much common among both distant generations, but one there’s one question which both didn’t knew even after myriads of bounds and leaps it still remains unanswered, where do we come from?</p>

            <p>If something happens beyond our understanding humans have tendency to deem it as supernatural, so what might be more worthy of this title than our origin. Early humans have tried to explain origin of life through the help of an omnipresent and all-powerful deity which is commonly known as god now a days. <p>
            
            <div class="buffer"></div>
            <center><img class="img-fluid" src="../res/img/post/post4.jpg" alt></center>
            <div class="quote">Tribes living near these sky touching plateaus in Venezuela believe gods live there on the top. It’s not their ignorance rather the majesty of these structures which reach dizzying heights and it’s almost impossible to reach their top without any aircraft.</div>
            <div class="buffer"></div>

            <p>For ancient Indians the peaks of mighty Himalayas were thought to be to abode of gods, for Romans the god lived in mortifying volcanos, regarded as furnace of gods which fuelled life on land. But now with advanced knowledge and intellect or just common sense we can easily refute those absurd claims. Or can we?</p>

            <p>About 90% of people alive today are religious and almost all of these religions takes the naïve approach of ‘creationism’ when it comes to question of origin of life. Abrahamic religions which includes Christianity , Islam and Judaism asserts the fact that an supernatural deity sent two humans, famous ‘Adam and Eve’ and they populated the Earth, as incongruous as this claim sounds, is it’s assumption that Earth was created in 6 days and it’s about 6000 years old (we will come to this later). In Indic religions such as Hinduism the ‘Brahma’ created the universe singlehandedly.</p>
        
            <div class="subheading2">Modern theories on origin of life</div>

            <p>External Seeding Theory: There’s nothing more complex than life. Period. This theory believes that such levels of sophistications can’t originate on Earth rather life came from other planet on an space projectile but there’s nothing more hostile to life than space and the seeds of life i.e. DNA chains can’t endure such harsh journey.</p>

            <p>Alien Pod Theory: So if life can’t endure a journey through space to Earth than it must have properly shielded from galactic radiation and other extremes which means some alien civilization packed the seeds of life in a durable space-pod and aimed it to Earth. But, it like the external seeding theory fails to explain the origin of life on place from where it began its journey.</p>

            <p>Creationism: As ancient as this may sound it’s still one of the most revered explanations of life for billions of humans even today.</p>

            <p>Primordial Soup Theory: Among all other theories here this might have most appetizing name. The Primordial Soup is the state of Earth in its infancy when it was only couple of million years old. Surface temperatures were near boiling point of water, oceans were still developing with waves hundreds of meters high due to proximity of newly formed moon, constant volcanic eruptions and bombardment by asteroids. So these might not be ideal place for life to exist as we know today (we are fragile things). This is known as Primordial Soup.</p>

            <p>Imagine Earth about 4 billons years ago (that’s a long long numbers which overflows in our brain so don’t worry if you can’t comprehend it) with boiling and violent ocean, ammonia and sulphur rich atmosphere with constant lightning from the clouds above. What might happen if these situations exists for millions of years?</p>

            <p>In 1920 chemists Miller and Urey asked the same question, can life originate from nothing but lifeless matter? </p>

            <p>They designed the famous Miller-Urey Experiment, it consisted of 5 Litre flask filled with gases and other chemicals exactly as predicted by Primordial Soup Theory and they sparked lightning at intervals to simulate violent skies of early Earth. If this succeeds then for once and ever the greatest question can be answered.</p>

            <p>At the end of week the contents of flask were studied and 5 out of 20 naturally occurring amino acids (building blocks of proteins and hence life) were present, later on in 2007 scientists equipped with advanced quantitative analysis techniques once again analysed the sealed content isolated from the original experiment and to the sheer amusement, about 20 amino acids were found. So there we have it, building blocks of life spontaneously originating from nothing closely related to life. </p>

            <div class="quote">"Just turning on the spark in a basic pre-biotic experiment will yield 11 out of 20 amino acids"</div>

            <p>Miller and Urey experiment loosely proved that divine intervention is not required to create life, still it didn’t create life but only its building blocks. This may be attributed to the time constraint faced during the experiment which was only a week, Earth on other hand took about 4 billion years to create life as we see it. The inability to grasp and visualise this timeframe of 4 billion years is the reason why it’s difficult for many to accept evolution of species through natural selection.  After all Rome wasn’t built in a day.</p>

            <div class="quote">"“Given enough time order may rise out of chaos”"</div>

            <p>But why would molecules bind or unbind to form something as intricate as life? The answer to this question might be embedded into nitty gritty of physical laws which governs universe.</p>
