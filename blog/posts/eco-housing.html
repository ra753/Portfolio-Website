            <div class="line"></div>
            <p>Housing is essentially vital for the survival of a human being, it provides security, comfort, community, and health while fulfilling a plethora of other basic requirements. Considering the importance of adequate housing it should be deemed as a basic human right at par with other inalienable rights such as the right to liberty and right to life.
            </p>
            <p>Housing, for long, had been a place to live, often along with farmland attached. It was passed from generation to generation and held strong cultural and emotional significance. 
            <p>
            <p>Housing in the twenty-first century is no longer a human dwelling and basic human need, rather it has been actively transformed into a commodity, a financial instrument that could be traded and speculated upon. The ever existing wealth inequality provided the wealthy an opportunity to expand their riches by buying-out houses in densely populated urban centers around the world which tilted the supply-demand curve towards their favor. The billion-dollar enterprises and investment funds started siphoning off housing infrastructure to use it as a hedge against future uncertainties.
            </p>
            <p>Housing is now in short supply which has resulted in real estate costs skyrocketing around the world, most of the built structures are lying vacant as they were never purchased for dwelling but as a commodity to squeeze maximum returns. This dramatic increase in housing prices has made housing unaffordable for the masses, who need it as a shelter, to put a roof over their head and provide them with security, assurance and dignity to live. Exorbitant housing costs have led to homelessness at an unprecedented scale in many countries, people are compelled to live in confined and filthy spaces while clearing swathes of land for luxury housing projects which in most cases will lie vacant as a store of wealth.
            </p>
            <p>Governments around the world should strive to solve the issue. Luxury housing should be taxed higher and revenue from it can be employed to provide subsidies to budget housing projects. It can back mortgages for subsidized housing buyers in order to instill confidence in lenders, while this may sound fiscally unattainable but it certainly is achievable if efforts are extended. 
            </p>

            <p>If concrete steps are not taken to ameliorate the housing crisis then it would only exacerbate the now unsustainable wealth gap.</p>

            <p>Indian Government has set an ambitious target of eliminating both urban and rural homelessness by 75th Independence Day i.e, year 2022. Number of government schemes were devised to achieve this target primary among them is Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), which aims to subsidise interest rates for those buying their own home for the first time in any urban region. Pradhan Mantri Gramin Awas Yojana (PMGAY) was formulated to assist economically weaker sections in rural areas to build or repair existing houses.  It would be one of the greatest accomplishments of independent India if it could empower everyone of its citizens with a roof over their head.
            </p>
            <div class=line></div>

            <p><i>And at last, it is important to build houses for those who want to live in it rather than those who want to use it as a financial instrument to harvest unethical dividends. 
            </i></p>
