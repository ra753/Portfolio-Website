<div class=mainHeading2>The Trillion Dollar Vaccine</div>
<div class=line></div>
<p>More than 60% of the world population is under some kind of lockdown, a desperate attempt to prevent overwhelming healthcare systems at the cost of economic growth. Lockdown is a temporary solution to a pandemic, over the next few months governments around the world will be facing enormous pressure to ease up the restrictions to mitigate economic doom.
</p>
<p>Developing a vaccine for COVID-19 is only a viable way to bring back the world to normalcy, and unfortunately, that's a long way down.
<p>
<div class=subheading2>Vaccine, what?</div>
<p>To understand vaccines we need to know how our body deals with SARS-CoV2 (coronavirus), to kill invading pathogens, the immune system sends specialized cells called lymphocytes which can evolve rapidly and produce Antibodies specific for that virus. Lymphocytes trigger something called cytokine-storm, a distressed attempt to fight off the virus but it can be fatal to the body itself and cytokine-storm is what’s killing people infected with COVID-19, not the virus itself.
</p>
<div class=quote>“After the cytokine-storm kicks in a, coin is flipped, either infected person dies or antibodies are produced to save the day”</div>
<p>A vaccine leads directly to the antibody generation phase with negligible adverse symptoms that occurs otherwise.</p>
<div class=subheading2>How is it made?</div>
<p>Vaccines contain weakened and deactivated pathogens, which are feeble enough not to cause any major symptom and strong enough to activate immune response at the same time. This immune response generates antibodies for SARS-CoV2. Afterward, the immune system can produce antibodies for COVID-19 whenever it is encountered in the body.

Hence providing us with permanent immunity.
</p>
<div class=subheading2>The Present</div>
<p>Major pharmaceuticals and biotechnology companies are collaborating to develop a vaccine for COVID19, about 115 such vaccines are being worked upon. Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) is coordinating corporations and academicians.
</p>
<p>Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline, both fierce competitors in their industry have come together to research a vaccine.
</p>
<p>Moderna’s mRNA type vaccine is already in the trial phase, it’s technique is new so getting regulatory approvals will be on a tight leash. Moderna founder soon made it to the billionaire’s list after the company announced the initiation of human trials.
</p>
<p>Indian companies including Zydus Cadila, Indian Immunology and Serum Institute are also working towards a COVID19 vaccine.
</p>
<div class=subheading2>The Timeline</div>
<p>Injecting weakened viruses in the body is a risky business as the slightest of errors can be fatal, so making sure the vaccine's reliability and safety are paramount. Therefore it has to go through extensive trials among a diverse population.
</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Vaccine is developed</li>
<li>Animal trials begin</li>
<li><b>Phase-1 Human Trials</b>, a small group of people who have a low risk of developing symptoms are given a dose. This step makes sure that there’s no inherent side effect of the medicine.
</li>
<li>
<b>Phase-2 Human Trial</b>, the vaccine is administered to those at high risk of catching the infection such as doctors, nurses and frontline workers.
</li>
<li><b>Phase-3 Human Trial</b>, mass testing of vaccine begins, thousands of people are given a dose of the vaccine.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>After Phase-3 trials, the effectiveness, reliability, and safety of the vaccine are calculated if everything goes well then the vaccine is ready for mass administration.
</p>
<div class=quote>“May statistics save us all”</div>
<p>This whole process generally takes 5-6 years but since we are in extraordinary circumstances the process might be streamlined to reduce the time significantly. Estimates say it may take anywhere between 18-36 months before we get a working antidote. The best case will be 18 months and the worst case could be well, we never find a cure (highly unlikely though).
</p>
<div class=subheading2>The Final Challenge</div>
<p>After getting a successful vaccine the next big step would be to give it to the people, but that’s not gonna be easy. There are 8 billion of us and who gets it first?
</p>
<p>Eight billion doses of the new vaccine should be manufactured afterward comes the distribution phase, with global supply chains already strained it’s difficult to imagine the scenario by then. The division between rich and poor will play a crucial role in the administration of the cure and if governments fail to properly equalize distribution then social fabric could be stretched by disgruntled citizens.
</p>
<div class=subheading2>Summing Up</div>
<p>The next few months are going to be tough if the curve doesn’t show any flattening in India. Forty days of complete lockdown is much more than anyone had anticipated and it’s very unlikely that the government can pull off this total lockdown any further after 3rd May. Testing rates right now are pathetically low, higher testing can provide a sharper picture of the current scenario and without ramping it up we will not be seeing any relief in the coming weeks.
</p>
<p>We are still at least a year away from developing any permanent cure for this disease, only passive and temporary solutions can help us to sail through these turbulent times.
