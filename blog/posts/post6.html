            <div class="line"></div>
            <p>It started with Germany invading Poland. After humiliating defeat in World War-1, once a proud nation of Germania had to swallow its pride; it was struck by winning powers - French, British and Americans with responsibility of starting the most destructive war in human history (till that time). Winners imposed Germany with War Reparations to cover their war expenses, shrink its military to abysmal numbers to make Germany too weak to rise ever again.
            </p>

            <p>With the Great Depression in the 1930s, Germany started delaying reparations, winners were furious. French invaded and captured the Ruhr region, filled with coal and iron ore; it was Germany's industrial hub. These desperate times gave rise to an outsider with stark political ideology, Adolf Hitler with his promise of restoring Deutschland to its former glory, establishing a Third Reich that would last a thousand years.</p>
            <p>Within half a decade Hitler transformed Germany with the world's largest Airforce - Luffwaffe, armada of U-Boats - Kriegsmarine and a Army - Wehrmacht. It shortly became the fiercest and deadliest military power to ever exist. 
            </p>

            <p>Germany unleashed the fury and went on a spree, conquering the whole of Europe in a matter of months with a new warfare technique called <u>“Blitzkrieg”</u> or lightning war. This later gave rise to the term “German Efficiency”.
            </p>

            <p>On the other side of the world, Japan also realized its global ambitions and invaded China, Korea, Indo-China, British India and the Pacific. Two nations wasted no time and formed a pact of peace and support for their endeavours. 
            </p>

            <div class=subheading2>Afterwards
            </div>            <p>The greatest conflict in human history which left tens of millions dead, ravaged continents, also gave rise to new technologies and changed the status quo. <u>Real winner of the war was the United States</u> which was left unscratched with the keys of the world and went on to establish its hegemony post war.
            </p>
            <p>The World War - 2 was a major reason for the decline of colonialism as most colonial powers were too ravaged to sustain a global empire hence were compelled to grant independence to their colonies.
            </p>

            <p>The World War - 2 was a technological and scientific renaissance, Computers, Rockets, Civil Aviations, Synthetic Polymers, Mass Production, Nuclear Power (the list goes on) were the direct result of innovations made for the war effort. 
            </p>

            <p><i>The war paved the way for the Atomic and Space Age. 
            </i></p>

            <p>Nuclear weapons which concluded the war, also marked an end to such full fledged military expeditions. Wrath and mass destruction capabilities of nuclear weapons ensured that a full scale war would never be an option in future conflicts. Today a war is never fought between countries physically rather they employ Espionage, Diplomacy and Economic Sanctions. </p>

            <p>The United Nations, International Monetary Fund, World Bank and several other institutions were established after the war to make nations across the world interdependent upon each other such that waging war becomes theoretically impossible.
            </p>

            <div class="quote">“Wars of territorial conquests were made illegal and a crime against humanity”            </div>

            <p>The deadliest conflict in human history ushered an era of peace, there has not been any major military conflict in the world after World War - 2 and it's highly unlikely there will be.
            </p>

            <p>An event with such profound effects on our lives, though, has little relevance among many today so here’s a compiled list of Documentaries and Films across dozens of genres, languages and cultures to provide a perspective.
